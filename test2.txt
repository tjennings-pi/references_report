The Code establishes minimum standards that address problem gambling, underage gambling and responsible marketing and advertising.\n\nThe information and resources on this page help players like you gamble responsibly.

For instance, you\u2019ll never know when your favorite player will get injured, how the weather will affect your favorite match ups, or if a player will change teams. While there is true randomness in slot machine play (i.e. each outcome is as likely to occur as the last), in sports betting we assign odds to an event. Odds indicate the likelihood of an event to occur and the return you\u2019d get if you were to make a wager on the result of a sport related outcome. While disciplined research and sport expertise certainly add to the skill based nature of sports betting, the exhilarating notion of randomness will always be in play!",

You can request to voluntary place yourself in this Database by contacting the MGCB here. \n\nThis is a formal process whereby you request through the MGCB that interactive gaming and sports betting operators prevent you from accessing gambling services. You may request a self-exclusion through the Board for a term of one or five years. You may also exclude for interactive gaming, sports wagering, or both.\n\nIf you would like to contest your placement in the Responsible Gaming Database, please contact the MGCB at the above link.\n\nOperator self-exclusion is a formal process whereby you request permanent exclusion through the Barstool Sportsbook that will prevent you from accessing this or any other Penn National Gaming, Inc. owned or operated online real money gaming product and physical casino.\n\nIf you choose to self-exclude through either of the above options we will close your account and return any remaining balance, unless otherwise required by MGCB regulation. Once you self-exclude through the Barstool Sportsbook Permanent Exclusion Option, we cannot reverse the process for any reason. During your self-exclusion period, we will not send you any marketing material, and we cannot accept any deposits or bets. You may contact Barstool Player Experience if you need to request a withdrawal. Please note that any marketing materials which have already been dispatched may be delivered.\n",

To enroll in the program, individuals may apply, in person, at any Indiana-based casino, the IGC office in Indianapolis, or with a designated problem gambling treatment provider. You may elect to self-exclude for a period of one (1) year, five (5) years, or lifetime.
